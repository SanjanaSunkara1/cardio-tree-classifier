# ​​ Cardio-Tree Classifier

A mini machine learning project to **predict heart disease risk** using a Decision Tree model. This repository is a great starter for understanding classification using health data and hands-on practice with Python and Scikit-learn. Originally created under the Girls Who Code Self-Paced Program. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

##  ✨ Features

-  **Decision Tree Classifier** — Implements a straightforward decision tree model to predict heart disease.
-  **Scikit-Learn Integration** — Built with `scikit-learn` for model creation, training, and evaluation.
-  **Train/Test Split** — Divides data into training and testing sets to assess performance. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
-  **Reusable Helpers** — `helperfunctions.py` supports the main prediction logic in `predict.py`.

##  📊 About the Data

- **Dataset**: `heartDisease_2020_sampling.csv` — contains relevant features for predicting cardiovascular risk. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- **Purpose**: Provides a simplified, real-world-like dataset for learning classification workflows.
- Decision tree models are prized for their interpretability and have been shown to achieve reasonably high accuracy (often around 80–85%) in heart disease prediction tasks.

##  🧩 Extensions & Tools Used

- **Python 3** — primary language for scripts.
- **scikit-learn** — building and using the Decision Tree model.
- **pandas + numpy** — for data handling and manipulation.
- **Poetry or pip** — use either dependency manager or plain venv setup.
- **CSV files** — lightweight data format for training and testing.
- **Girls Who Code Self-Paced Program** — this structure and approach comes from that curriculum. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
